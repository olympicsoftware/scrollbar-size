## <a name="installation-usage"></a>Installation/Usage

### Node.js ([atom-shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell), [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) etc.)

To install for usage with node.js

    npm install --save scrollbar-size

Then just require the module:

    var scrollbarSize = require("scrollbar-size");

The function `scrollbarSize` will return the width of scrollbars for the running
platform.

### Notes

The function will return undefined if it is called before the document is ready.

The size of the scrollbar is only calculated the first time the function is
called. If your platform has scrollbars that resize, this module will not work
for you.
